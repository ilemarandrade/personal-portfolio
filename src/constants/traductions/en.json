    "second_paragraph": "I enjoy learning new things, spending time with my guitar and singing along with my wife, play basketball, lighting up as much as I can and of course all the NBA highlights.",
    "third_paragraph": "I love teaching almost anything, that's why I also enjoy being a mentor at the Swordvoice software developer academy; In my community, also with my wife I teach music for non profit to young people who want to increase their knowledge of an instrument or their voices. I wish one day to be a father and also teach him everything I know and guide him to achieve all his dreams with perseverance."
